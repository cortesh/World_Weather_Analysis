# World_Weather_Analysis

## Note Bene:

The Challenge starter code assumes the config file is in the same folder as the jupyter Notebook.  I have therefore stored the .ipynb files in the general World_Weather_Analysis folder to run all cells and only at the end stored the files in their respective folders.  I could figure out no other way to get starter code to work.
